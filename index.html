      Welcome to Interactive Media 1! Interactive Media 1 is about enabling you
      to engage with the fundamentals of interaction design through the use of
      web programming. Our focus will be on building up from the basic
      principles of programming, covering the standard web languages - HTML, CSS
      and JavaScript, in order to be able to select and use appropriate
      programming languages, together with core concepts of interaction design,
      in service of your broader digital design goals.
