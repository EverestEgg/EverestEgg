        <p>
            <!-- Make sure the paragaph text can entierly fit in the VSC area -->
            I paid attention to the vibrant and highly saturated art style, especially as it was contently moving. 
            I also focused on the unexpected feature of having to resize the browser. I have never seen that implemented 
            as a significant feature before, it intrigued me and made me want to explore the rest of the website.  
        </p>
        <h4 class="title">What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?  </h4>
        <p>
            When I first tried to access it, I used my laptop witch I couldn’t shrink the window small
             enough to get the website to move beyond the 1st screen. In only worked when I tried it on 
             my PC as it had a bigger screen where I could get the right proportions.

            In 2 minutes, I: 
            <menu>
                <!-- Made a List for the quesitions that wanted me to list things and have it be formated cleaner -->
                <li>Resize the browser – To move to the next scene and have the proportion of a phone </li>
                <li>Dragged – To see the whole scene and transferer the to next one </li>
                <li>Clicked – to play the hidden animation and view the cinematic scene </li>

        </p>
        <h4 class="title">What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the experience?  </h4>
        <p>
            The most common action in the two minuids dragging, as there are two core features that utilize it. 
            The wheel that changed the scene and time of day. And dragging to view the entire scene, as parts of 
            the scene rested out of view. I was using dragging mostly for this due to the time I spent hunting for
             the small animation.      
        </p>
        <h4 class="title">What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with? </h4>
        <p>
            I spent most of most time trying to find the hidden animation, it was the feature I had the most fun with. 
            It was like a treasure hunt in each scene. I also don’t think there was an animation in every scene, as I 
            looked all over them and didn't find one every time. Or I just missed it.

    <div id="goal" class="topics">
        <section class="title">Primary Goal</section>
        <h4 class="title">What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?  </h4>
        <p>
            The website is designed to evoke the feeling of a nice summer day. Specifically, a summer holiday at the beach.
            Creating a sense of nostalgia and reminiscing about the good days, even if the viewer hasn't had an experience
            that compares to what Mille’s is showing.   
        </p>
        <h4 class="title"> How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?  </h4>
        <p>
            This is done through a combination of visuals and audio. With the audio doing a lot of the emotional heavy
             lifting, the music evokes feelings of nostalgia and calm. While the ambience is used to set the environments,
              using calming sounds and ones associated with the beach. I found myself often holding the music and just
               listening to the ambience, my favorite weas the cat purring.
