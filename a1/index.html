        <h4 class="title"> What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?  </h4>
        <p>
            The hand drawn art style was very vibrant, constantly moving and highly saturated.  
            And also the unexpected feature of playing around with and having to resizs my browser windond
            intrigued me and made me want to find out why and what their were doing to do with the feature.  
        </p>
        <h4 class="title">What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?  </h4>
        <p>
            When I first tried to access it I used my laptop witch I couldn’t shrink the window small enough to get the website
             to move beyond the 1st screen. In only worked when I tried it on my Pc as it had a bigger scene where I could get 
             the right proportions.   
        </p>
        <h4 class="title">What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?  </h4>

        <h4 class="title"> Spend two minutes on the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions. </h4>
        <p>
            Resising the browser (fun gimmick, to make the sceen with phone proportions) 
            Drag (to move the whele and change the time, as well as moce the sene aroung to see everything) 
            Click (to find the hidden animation and make it play, and to view the cinimatic scene with text in each time) 
            hold (to turn the music of and lisned to the ambience) 
        </p>
        <h4 class="title">What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the experience?  </h4>
        <p>
            The most common action would have been dragging, I there was 2 core feature that required it, the wheel 
            that changed the time and the scene. As well as dragging to view the entire scene, as elements rested out 
            of view and I was spending a lot of time hunting for the small animation.    
        </p>
        <h4 class="title">What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with? </h4>
        <p>
            Clicking around the screen to try and find the little animation, as it was like a treasure hunt on the
             website, I don’t think I found them all and I am still not sure their was 1 in every scene.

        <h4 class="title"> How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?  </h4>
        <p>
            Calmbing music, summer soundscapes, (the cat noises is my favrouite). The visual style. The little animation having a sence of joy and delite that youy feel on a summer day
